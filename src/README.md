# Source code

## main.c
Template implementation for the main part of a C/C++ demo application.

## common.c/h
These contain utility methods for parsing, setting, and reporting
the usage of command-line arguments common to all of our C/C++ demo applications,
as well as other methods that we commonly use across our
C/C++ demo applications, e.g., standard methods for I/O handling. These
source files are symlinks to the original files contained in the repository
[Signaloid-Demo-CommonUtilityRoutines](https://github.com/signaloid/Signaloid-Demo-CommonUtilityRoutines)
which is included as a submodule in `submodules/common`.

## config.mk
Signaloid cores use this file to identify the source codes they will use when
building the C/C++ demo application.
